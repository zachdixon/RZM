            Back in 1999, well before the current Fantasy Football explosion, a group of Dallas Cowboy fans wanted to make NFL Sundays more exciting. Sure, every Sunday the Cowboys would get their juices flowing, but what about all those other games on TV – the Giants vs. the Redskins, the Lions playing the Packers, the Dolphins against the Jets? Without having a “rooting interest” in those games, they just weren’t as much fun to watch. (And no seedy local “bookie” or flashy trips to Vegas to bet on a few games would work for these boys.) They were just good-ol’, law-abiding, patriotic Texas citizens who wanted to add a little more fun to their NFL Sundays. So they came up with the idea of forming their own private league and competing against each other to see who would be the best "picker" each week.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each player would select their five favorite games each week -- the ones they thought were sure winners -- and each guy would bet 250 fake dollars or their top game, 200 fake dollars on their next favorite game right down to betting 50 imaginary dollars on their least favorite game. Each week, the winner would be the guy who won the most fake dollars, and would thus become "The Picker of the Week" and the star of the league. And at the end of the year, the guy who earned the most total fake dollars would be crowned "King Monkey" and be treated to a deluxe "Oysters and Beer Extravaganza" with much fanfare and debauchery.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that's how, in 1999, the original "Beat The Monkey" league (don't ask) was formed -- not a league based on NFL players statistics, but a league based on actual NFL game outcomes, using "the spread," to find out which league member could become the best picker on every NFL Sunday and over an entire season.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, over a dozen years after its inception, the original "Beat The Monkey" league has evolved into RedZone Mania -- an exciting, web and app/based game with lots of bells, whistles and new additions that will help make your NFL football Sundays the most exciting day of the week. Don't worry. The original concept is still intact, but by adding game-day "Chatter," "Rivalry," "Survivor," "Upset Special," "Lock Of The Week," and "Monday Football @ Night," RedZone Mania is now ready for Prime-Time, and is ready to be played right along with your Fantasy Football League. So gather your friends, your family, your co-workers, and particularly, YOUR FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE and sign-up to enjoy everything RedZone Mania was, and now has become.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure, fantasy football is great. All of us RedZone Maniacs love it, too!!! But real NFL football fans DO NOT live by scrolls at the bottom of the screen alone. They want all the action an NFL Sunday can deliver-- and RedZone Mania makes it happen!
          </p>
          <p>
            So when it comes to watching real games, with real teams and making every single NFL play count, nothing beats the fun, intensity and competition of RedZone Mania. Don’t believe us? Wanna bet?
